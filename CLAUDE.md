# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Claude Code skill for generating Japanese comedy responses (大喜利/Ogiri). Ogiri is a form of Japanese improvisational comedy where participants provide witty, unexpected answers to prompts.

## Repository Structure

- `.claude/skills/ogiri-ai/SKILL.md` - The main skill definition containing comprehensive instructions for generating Ogiri responses
- `.claude/settings.json` - Claude Code configuration with Jujutsu VCS integration

## Version Control

This project uses **Jujutsu (jj)** as the primary version control system, with Git as the backing store.

## Skill Files

The `.claude/skills/ogiri-ai/SKILL.md` file contains the main skill logic. This file is experimental and frequently updated with different approaches to generating humor. Refer to the skill file itself for the current methodology.

## Language Guidelines

When creating or modifying files in this repository:
- **Ogiri-related content** (e.g., `.claude/skills/ogiri-ai/`) should be written in **Japanese**
- General infrastructure should be written in **English**
